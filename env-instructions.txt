# Instructions for setting up Supabase authentication in Axiom Engine

To fix the "Invalid API key" error, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of your Axiom Engine project with the following content:

```
# Supabase configuration
# The URL is correct (based on the 401 error)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://ccbvfyyxdlojebatfupf.supabase.co

# IMPORTANT: Copy the correct anon key from your main app
# The current key is invalid (getting 401 error)
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-correct-anon-key-here
```

Steps to resolve this issue:

1. Find your main app's `.env` file and copy the value for `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
2. Create a new file named `.env` in the Axiom Engine root directory
3. Paste the contents above, replacing "your-correct-anon-key-here" with the actual key from your main app
4. Restart your development server after creating/updating the `.env` file

This will ensure that Supabase authentication works correctly in the InoAIPremium.tsx component.
